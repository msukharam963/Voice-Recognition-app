# Voice-Recognition-app
Hi, i'm Mihir Sukharamwala currently pursuing CSE at CHARUSAT University. <br>
This is the code to get you started with the basic voice recognition app. I would suggest you to read about Sphinx library in java and the use of it.<br>
This repository has only the source code for the voice recognition app. You have to add sphinx4-data and sphinx4-core with the 5prealpha version as a referenced library.<br>
Make a resource package and add commands.txt, .lm ,and .dic files.
