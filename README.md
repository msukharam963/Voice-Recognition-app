# Voice-Recognition-app
Hi, i'm Mihir Sukharamwala currently pursuing CSE at CHARUSAT University. 
This is the code to get u started with the basic voice recognition app. I would suggest you to read about Sphinx library in java and the use of it.

This repository has only the source code for the voice recognition app. You have to add sphinx4-data and sphinx4-core with the 5prealpha version as a referenced library.
Make a resource package and add commands.txt, .lm ,and .dic files.
